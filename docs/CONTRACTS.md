# Financial Agent — Contracts

**Status:** Current through M3 (2026-07-20) · Schemas are code: [`packages/finance-core/src/schemas/`](../packages/finance-core/src/schemas/) is normative; this doc is the map.

## 1. Record schemas (zod, versioned)

| Record | Schema | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Portfolio state | `PortfolioState` | reconciliation metadata reserved now; Phase 1 `source: manual_chat_crud`, `status: unreconciled` (flip at Phase 2 broker import — ARCHITECTURE §4) |
| Transactions | `AnyTransaction` | BUY / SELL / DIVIDEND / DEPOSIT / WITHDRAWAL / FEE / FX_CONVERT. Records of what happened — **no order/lifecycle states exist** |
| Snapshot | `Snapshot` | v2 links each immutable daily history point to its health-report run and portfolio input hash; feeds reporting only (v1 remains readable) |
| Alert rule | `AlertRule`, `RulesFile` | alert-only; `.strict()` rejects `mode`/`action`/any execution shape at parse time (tested) |
| Journal | `JournalEntry`, `Postmortem` | risks + invalidation conditions are required, not optional |
| Run/audit | `RunRecord` | every automated run; model ID recorded iff an LLM ran |
| Reports | `StockResearchReport`, `ValuationReport`, `EarningsReport`, `OptionsReport`, `PortfolioHealthReport`, `MonitorAlert`, `DailyDigest` | per-type validators (ARCHITECTURE §10); `DisciplineBlock` on stock views |
| Calculations | `DcfCalculationRecord`, `OptionPayoffRecord` | exact input + canonical SHA-256 hash + run ID; immutable CLI outputs |

All records carry `schemaVersion` (per-type, independent bumps). Currency changes happen
**only** via explicit `FX_CONVERT` — silent conversion is structurally impossible.

## 2. Calculation engine (finance-core)

- `processTransactions(txns) → LedgerState` — holdings (weighted-average cost, buy fees
  capitalized, sell fees off proceeds), cash by currency, realized P&L, dividends.
- `valuePortfolio(input) → Valuation` — total value, per-position value/weight/unrealized
  P&L, bucket weights, currency exposure, stale-quote flags (>30h configurable),
  concentration flags (individual stock > `singleStockMax`, default 0.10).
- `runDcfValuation(request) → DcfCalculationRecord` — sourced free cash flow, net debt,
  diluted shares, bull/base/bear DCF, and sensitivity grid. Rejects silent currency
  mismatch and discount rates at or below terminal growth.
- `runOptionPayoff(request) → OptionPayoffRecord` — covered-call and long-call break-even,
  maximum profit/loss, premium yield where applicable, and expiry payoff grid with an
  explicit contract multiplier.
- `buildStockResearchReport(request) → StockResearchReport` — derives report scenario and
  discipline numbers from a parsed DCF record; rejects misordered bear/base/bull outputs.
- `health-report` remains the allocation calculation entry point: it computes current
  weights/drift via finance-core, records the run, and idempotently captures the first daily
  snapshot rather than duplicating allocation math.
- `createPortfolioSnapshot(report, portfolioHash)` derives snapshot values only from a
  validated health report. `calculatePercentChange(reference, current)` keeps the remaining
  watchlist display arithmetic out of the dashboard repository.
- Documented Phase-1 simplifications: average-cost basis (not lot-level); realized P&L and
  dividends converted at current fx, not transaction-time fx. Both revisit at Phase 2
  broker import.
- Tolerances (`TOLERANCES`): money ±0.01 · weights ±0.0001 (0.01pp) · IRR ±0.001.

## 3. Golden fixtures (`tests/fixtures/`)

`simple-buy-hold` · `partial-sale` · `dividend` · `aud-usd-deposit` · `brokerage-fees` ·
`stale-price` — inputs validated through the real schemas, outputs compared within
tolerances, weight-sum invariants checked. Add with their features: stock-split,
option-expiry, option-assignment, multi-account-transfer.

## 4. ID formats

```
run_20260720T093012Z_a3f1     RunId          (makeRunId())
snap_20260720_us_close        SnapshotEventId
txn_20260720_0001             TransactionId
jrnl_20260720_avgo-entry      JournalId
portfolio_20260720_001        PortfolioVersion
```

## 5. MCP tool contracts (runtime-neutral)

Thin adapters over finance-core (ARCHITECTURE §2). Inputs/outputs are the schemas above.
Read tools are freely callable; **write tools require explicit user confirmation in chat**
(SECURITY §5); no trade/order tool exists.

| Tool | In → Out | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `portfolio.get_state` | – → `PortfolioState` | read |
| `portfolio.get_valuation` | – → `Valuation` (live quotes + fx) | read |
| `portfolio.get_health` | – → `PortfolioHealthReport` | read |
| `market.get_quotes` | `symbols[]` → `ProviderQuote[]` | read |
| `market.get_fundamentals` | `symbols[]` → `ProviderFundamentals[]` | read |
| `market.get_fx` | `from,to` → `ProviderFxRate` | read |
| `filings.search` / `filings.get` | symbol/formTypes → `FilingRef[]` / text | read (M2) |
| `rules.list` / `rules.validate` | – / candidate → rules / issues | read |
| `rules.upsert` | `AlertRule` → ok | **confirm** |
| `portfolio.record_transaction` | `AnyTransaction` → new `PortfolioState` | **confirm** |
| `journal.create_entry` / `journal.create_postmortem` | entry → id | **confirm** |
| `journal.search` | query → entries | read |
| `reports.validate` | reportType + payload → issues | read |
| `snapshots.capture` | – → `Snapshot` | scheduler/CLI only |

## 6. Provider interfaces

`MarketDataProvider` · `HistoryProvider` · `FxProvider` · `FilingsProvider`
([`packages/data-providers/src/interfaces.ts`](../packages/data-providers/src/interfaces.ts)).
Every result carries source + timestamp + currency + delayed status; missing metadata is a
hard fail; provider output is untrusted input (SECURITY §3).

M2 adds `SecEdgarProvider`: ticker → CIK through the official SEC map, recent submission
metadata through `data.sec.gov`, and allowlisted original filing content under
`www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/`. A declared contact-bearing User-Agent is mandatory;
callers must remain below the SEC's 10 requests/second ceiling.

## 7. Storage integrity primitives

`atomicWriteFile` (tmp+rename) · `atomicCreateFile` (immutable create) · `appendJsonl` ·
`readJsonl` (recovers a malformed final line, throws on mid-file corruption) ·
`detectSyncConflicts` (Obsidian/git artifacts) · `createDailySnapshotFile` (immutable,
idempotent daily capture) · `loadDashboardReadModel` (validated current report, sorted
history, independent freshness/completeness, provenance, fail-closed errors) · validated Markdown journal
create/search with linked postmortems
([`packages/storage/src/index.ts`](../packages/storage/src/index.ts)). Conflict resolution
path: ARCHITECTURE §4–5.

## 8. Research CLI and workflow assets (M2)

- `npm run valuation -- --input <json>` and `npm run options-payoff -- --input <json>`
  validate inputs, create immutable calculation records, and append `RunRecord` audit rows.
- `templates/` contains report, journal, and schema-valid calculation-input skeletons.
- `skills/financial-agent/SKILL.md` is the lean router; task procedures live one level down
  in `references/` and keep arithmetic in finance-core.
- `validateReport(reportType, payload)` checks report shape;
  `validateReportWithCalculations(reportType, payload, records)` additionally resolves
  DCF/options references and rejects any mismatched input hash, assumptions, terms,
  sensitivity point, scenario, payoff, or discipline number. `reports:validate` uses the
  strict form and requires `--calculation` for calculation-bearing reports.
- `npm run journal` exposes read-only search plus confirmed/audited entry and postmortem
  creation. Write subcommands fail unless the orchestration layer supplies `--confirmed`
  after explicit confirmation in chat; storage then validates links and sync-conflict state.

## 9. Dashboard read contract (M3)

The dashboard consumes one `loadDashboardReadModel({ dataDirectory })` interface. It returns
the latest validated `PortfolioHealthReport`, sorted `Snapshot[]`, aggregate status,
independent freshness/completeness, issues, and report filename/run/source timestamps. The
newest malformed report is an error; the loader never silently falls back to an older value.
Friday-close age uses finance-core's weekend-aware `marketAgeHours` rule. Snapshot points
whose valuation currency differs from the current report are excluded and surfaced as an
error; sync-conflict artifacts in report or snapshot storage also fail the read explicitly.

The sibling dashboard may enrich the watchlist and serve OHLC through the shared Yahoo
provider, but it does not parse or value the portfolio and exposes no data-write endpoint.

## 10. Monitoring contracts (M4)

- `evaluateAlertRules({ rules, observations, runId, generatedAt })` is the deterministic
  finance-core seam. It performs no I/O and returns schema-validated `monitorAlert` records.
- Percentage observations (`position_pct`, `bucket_pct`, `pnl_pct_from_entry`) use percentage
  points (for example, `12.5` means 12.5%), matching user-authored threshold language.
- Monetary conditions (`price`, `market_cap`) require currency; all other fields reject it.
  Alerts carry structured currency (or `null`), source, observed/data timestamps, threshold,
  stale state, rule ID, and the mandatory observation-not-instruction guidance.
- `alerts.jsonl` is an event log: `alert-created` records are dashboard-readable events and
  `alert-delivery` records retain every terminal adapter attempt. A successful delivery is
  the only state that removes an event from the pending queue.
- Dedup is per rule ID inside the scheduler's configured window and is serialized by a
  macOS `shlock` (atomic `link(2)` plus PID-liveness recovery). Pending delivery is atomically leased before adapter I/O, so overlapping
  cycles cannot send the same event. A retry can deliver an existing pending event but
  cannot create another event in the same window.
- Provider failures are isolated per symbol/input, recorded in `runs.jsonl`, and cause a
  non-zero CLI exit after unaffected evaluation and delivery work completes. No LLM is used.
